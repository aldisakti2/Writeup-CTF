I got a sweet desktop background for my favorite video game, but now I want more! Problem is, I forget where I downloaded it from... can you help me remember where I got this old one?

<strong>Download the file(s) below. Note, this is a 50MB compressed archive download, and 100MB uncompressed.</strong>

Our admin accidentally published some secret images on our site. Unfortunately, somehow we are not able to unpublish the secret image, however, we tried to apply some protection to our site. This should be enough, right?

This is a fully white box challenge, almost no heavy brute force is needed.

Challenge may take anywhere between 1-3 minutes to fully start up.

NOTE, the challenge has a non-standard flag format. You will find a CTF{} wrapper around standard english.

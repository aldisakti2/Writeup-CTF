Only if you fully agree with the described content and terms, do you proceed.________________________________________________DTL CompareMaster is an application for comparing the contour descriptions and hinting of glyphs in OpenType CFF and PostScript Type1 fonts.The program produces an extensive listing or a more compact summary as a generic text file. Also it is possible to generate plot files in the PostScript format.Under Mac OS X the PostScript file(s) generated by DTL CompareMaster can be viewed in Preview. This application uses Quartz 2D for its built-in PostScript-to-PDF document conversion.To be able to view the generated PostScript file(s) under Windows, an additional application like GhostView in combination with Ghostscript has to be installed first. Several distributions can be found on the web, amongst which the following .exe files: GSview 4.9: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/get49.htmGPL Ghostscript 8.60: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/doc/GPL/gpl860.htmAlternatively for instance the application PStill (http://www.wizards.de/~frank/pstill_win.html#download) can be used for generating PDF files, which can be viewed with for instance Adobe Acrobat or GSview.________________________________________________Installing:On macOS, extract the OTM download (.zip) and place the resulting folder somewhere on your system, for example in the Applications folder.
